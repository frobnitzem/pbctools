Changes in v2.5
---------------

* Thanks to Jan Saam, wrap and box are able to center the box on the
  center of mass of a selection. Added option "-centersel", added
  arguments "com" and "bb" to option "-center". Note, that "-center
  $sel" does not work anymore.
* Thanks to Axel Kohlmeyer, join now checks whether the pbc cell
  parameters are reasonable.
* Automatically generate HTML docs from the LaTeX docs.

  of the docs together with the plugin.
* Moved plugin to http://www.espresso-pp.de/projects/pbctools/ .

Changes in v2.3
---------------

* Bugfix (Thanks to Chris Maffeo!) of "pbc wrap -compound segment".
* Improved implementation of "pbc join -compound bonded", that uses
  VMDs "fragment" keyword now.
* Renamed "-rectangular" option of "pbc box" and "pbc wrap" to
  "-orthorhombic" (Translation hint thanks to Jon Halverson).

Changes in v2.2
---------------

* Docfixes.
* Changed default compound option of "pbc wrap" to "-nocompound".

Changes in v2.1
---------------

* Added "pbc join".
